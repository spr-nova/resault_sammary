## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Gridient
- 

### What I learned

I learned how to do a gredient in background

```html
<div class="card gred">
</div>
```

```css
.gred {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    hsl(252, 100%, 67%) 10%,
    hsl(241, 81%, 54%)
  )
};
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```



### Continued development

- Theory of color


### Useful resources

- [Elzero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skjr9fycnio) - helps me in gredient.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
