- 

### What I learned

I learned how to do a gredient in background

```html
<div class="card gred">
</div>
```

```css
.gred {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    hsl(252, 100%, 67%) 10%,
    hsl(241, 81%, 54%)
  )
};
```
how to use data json

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```



### Continued development

- Theory of color
- Json in javascript
